== Description ==
= FORGET VIDEO AND IMAGE COMPRESSION =

Instead of just doing traditional image compression, significantly damaging your website’s visual quality, like nearly all websites still do to this day, AI-optimize your images and videos. Only with SpeedSize™ can you present media without limitations. Display photos and videos that look the same as 4k and drastically improve your site's loading speed at the same time. This will improve conversions, drive more organic SEO traffic and most importantly - provide your customers the next level of user experience.

= LOADING SPEED VS VISUAL QUALITY =

The dilemma of performance vs. media quality arises every day for all online brands. A large media catalog and/or high quality media always translates to slow-loading. The standard solution is traditional image compression. Unfortunately, compression affects quality and doesn’t reduce the media size enough when the visual quality is passable. So the result is always poor user experience and/or bad SEO rankings, leading to missed conversions, or to put it more plainly, lost money.

= NEXT STANDARD OF MEDIA OPTIMIZATION =

Never again compromise visual quality for speed. Instead of doing traditional compression, use our proprietary tech, Neuroscience Media Optimization. SpeedSize™ is the only platform capable of optimizing media size so dramatically, without compromising visual quality. High-res images and videos can now be delivered with a few KBs. You can speed up your site, drive more organic SEO traffic and convert more, without any concessions.

* Fix your Core Web Vitals to improve your SEO, bounce rate and conversions
* Accelerate your site’s loading time by ~10x and enhance user experience
* Get ~90-99% smaller and visually lossless media size by integrating with the [SpeedSize™](https://speedsize.com/) platform
* Make your site stand out with highest visual quality available online
* rive more sales by empowering UX with high-res images and videos

= MEDIA WITHOUT LIMITS =

SpeedSize™ neuroscience-powered AI analyzes your media, recreates it in identical looking quality but smaller in size (only a few KBs), and delivers it from 400+ locations all across the globe. Start selling more by upgrading product presentation. Use 4k quality images and auto-play videos. Improve your Core Web Vitals, while displaying life-like imagery for each unique visitor’s browser and device. SpeedSize™ even generates hundreds of variations in all next-gen formats and resolutions.

= HOW IT WORKS =

The SpeedSize™️ plugin AI-optimizes media with neuroscience technology, making the internet faster and sharper than ever seen before. We AI-analyze each media file to the pixel, eliminate the data the human brain cannot perceive and auto-deliver the perfect variation, customized to each unique device and browser. The result, up to 99% smaller media with the best possible perceptible visual quality, so that brands can present sharper, life-like visual experiences to their visitors. This drives more organic SEO traffic and increases revenue from conversions, making it the perfect tool for all online brands looking to scale.

= SPEEDSIZE VS COMPRESSION =

At SpeedSize™, we don’t use any presets like every other compression platform. Each image is individually rendered to find the perfect size to quality ratio, so that the compression is not really compression at all. The results are undeniable…

= ONE-CLICK INTEGRATION =

Most Enterprise-level media optimization tools require a lot of manual labor. This means Complex APIs and coding processes. Alternatively, SpeedSize™️ offers an effortless integration, with all the customization you need to optimize your media individually. However, what’s so compelling about SpeedSize™️ is that you can optimize your site’s media automatically at any scale instantly with our Wordpress plugin.

For the best results, use your original high-res images and videos, so our AI will make it appear identically sharp to the human eye, but up to 99% smaller. In nearly every case, the higher quality the original image, the better results we can deliver.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I contact SpeedSize™ for a demo and/or consultation?

Go to the form at the bottom of our homepage at speedsize.com, so you can book a personalized demo where we will provide live examples from your site, and even optimize media files of your choice. Or email us at us at hi@speedsize.com

= Are there size restrictions for my website’s bandwidth?

There is no limit to the number of media files SpeedSize™ can optimize. We have clients that optimize over a billion images each month. The more the bandwidth of the media we AI-optimize for your site, the more discounted your rate. Just as your site will have no media limits, we have no limitations for volume.

= Which CDN do you use?

SpeedSize™️ thorough investigation found out that the most recommended CDN is the Amazon Cloudfront AWS CDN. Though this is the CDN with the fastest delivery and most failsafes, you do not need to change anything to implement our platform. With that said SpeedSize™️ is the only flexible CDN media optimization in the market - We can deliver images and videos regardless of the CDN for Enterprise-level clients.

= Why shouldn't I use freeware for compressing or altering images?

Every freeware compression, cropping, or resizing tool will greatly compromise visual quality for speed. Why should you have to choose between the two? And while it is possible to compress files to look relatively OK in many instances, for larger sites it would take thousands of man hours to accomplish at scale, without results anywhere near what SpeedSize™️ can deliver. SpeedSize uses the principles of neuroscience to deliver the highest resolution images and reduce them by up to ~99%, which no other AI platform can do and cannot be done manually at all. Another feature unique to SpeedSize™️ is device and browser adaptive image delivery. The right image is perfectly resized and reformatted specifically to every consumer, no matter what device or browser they use. We would gladly test our resizing that loses no visual quality against the best of designers and can help businesses save upwards of thousands of man hours.
